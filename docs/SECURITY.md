# Security Best Practices

## Overview

Scanlytic-ForensicAI v0.1.0 implements comprehensive security measures to ensure safe file analysis and protect user data.

## Security Features

### 1. Secure File Handling

- **Path Validation**: All file paths are validated and resolved to prevent path traversal attacks
- **Size Limits**: Configurable file size limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Permission Checks**: File permissions are verified before access
- **Safe Reading**: Files are read in chunks to prevent memory exhaustion
- **No Execution**: Files are never executed, only analyzed statically

### 2. Input Validation

- **Path Sanitization**: All input paths are sanitized and validated
- **Extension Validation**: File extensions are verified against content
- **Magic Number Validation**: File types verified using magic numbers
- **Boundary Checks**: All inputs have proper boundary validation

### 3. Data Protection

- **No Personal Data Collection**: The tool does not collect or transmit personal data
- **Local Processing**: All analysis is performed locally
- **Secure Hashing**: Industry-standard hash algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- **No External Calls**: No data sent to external services by default

### 4. Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Failures handled without exposing sensitive information
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for audit trails
- **Exception Hierarchy**: Custom exceptions for specific error cases
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly messages without leaking internal details

### 5. Configuration Security

- **Environment Variables**: Support for secure credential storage
- **File Permissions**: Configuration files should have restricted permissions
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API keys or credentials in code
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative default settings

## GDPR Compliance

### Data Minimization

- Only essential file metadata is collected
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is processed
- Analysis results contain only file characteristics

### Right to Erasure

- All analysis results are stored locally
- Users have complete control over data retention
- No remote data storage without explicit consent

### Data Portability

- Reports available in standard formats (JSON, CSV)
- Full export of analysis results
- No vendor lock-in

### Privacy by Design

- Local-only processing by default
- Optional external API integration (user-controlled)
- Minimal data retention
- No telemetry or tracking

## ISO/IEC 27001 Alignment

### Information Security Controls

#### A.9 Access Control
- File access permissions validated
- Read-only analysis (no modifications)
- Principle of least privilege

#### A.10 Cryptography
- Industry-standard hash algorithms
- Secure hash computation
- No weak cryptographic functions

#### A.12 Operations Security
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Secure logging
- Resource management

#### A.14 System Acquisition, Development and Maintenance
- Secure coding practices
- Code quality checks (pycodestyle)
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation

#### A.18 Compliance
- Open source license (MIT)
- No proprietary dependencies
- Transparent operation

## Security Recommendations for Users

### 1. System Setup

```bash
# Run with minimal privileges
python -m scanlytic analyze file.txt

# Set restrictive permissions on config
chmod 600 config/config.yaml

# Use virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Configuration

```yaml
# Recommended security settings
analysis:
  max_file_size: 104857600  # 100MB limit
  timeout: 300  # 5-minute timeout

security:
  validate_paths: true
  prevent_path_traversal: true
  max_string_length: 1000

privacy:
  anonymize_paths: true  # Enable for sensitive environments
  data_retention_days: 90
```

### 3. Network Security

- No network access required for core functionality
- External APIs are optional and user-controlled
- Rate limiting for API calls
- TLS/SSL for external connections

### 4. Audit and Monitoring

- Enable detailed logging for audit trails
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Regular security updates
- Review analysis results

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Report via GitHub Security Advisories
3. Include detailed description
4. Allow reasonable time for fix
5. Practice responsible disclosure
