## Project Conception

### The Initial Idea

**Question**: What help can be provided to forensic investigators dealing with massive amounts of data to be investigated?

**Observation**: Manual file triage takes too long and is error-prone.

**Solution Idea**: Automate the initial sorting using code.

### Validating the Idea

Before writing any code, questions were asked:

1. **Does this problem really exist?**
   - ✅ Yes - forensic investigators struggle with data volume
   - ✅ Industry reports confirm this is a widespread issue

2. **Has someone else solved it?**
   - ⚠️  Partial solutions exist but are expensive or proprietary
   - ✅ Opportunity for open-source solution

3. **Can this be built?**
   - ✅ Technical feasibility: Python + existing libraries
   - ✅ Skills available: File I/O, ML, data processing

4. **Will anyone use it?**
   - ✅ Clear user need
   - ✅ Open-source attracts community

**Decision**: I decide to proceed with the project ✅

## Problem Analysis

### Understanding the Problem Deeply

On paper I broke down the problem into components:

#### 1. Volume Challenge

**Problem**: Too many files to review manually

**Data**:

- Modern hard drive: 1TB = ~1 million average files
- Manual review: 10-20 seconds per file
- Total time: 2,800 - 5,500 hours (impossible!)

**Required Solution**: Automated processing at >100 files/minute

#### 2. Variety Challenge

**Problem**: Many different file types

**Examples**:

- Executables (.exe, .elf, .app)
- Documents (.pdf, .doc, .xls)
- Images (.jpg, .png, .gif)
- Archives (.zip, .rar, .7z)
- Scripts (.py, .js, .sh)

**Required Solution**: Universal file handling system

#### 3. Verification Challenge

**Problem**: Files can be disguised

**Example**: Malware named "vacation_photo.jpg" is actually an .exe

**Required Solution**: Content-based detection, not just file extension

#### 4. Prioritization Challenge

**Problem**: Which files to investigate first?

**Required Solution**: Risk scoring system

### Defining Success Criteria

I defined what "success" looks like:

| Metric | Target | Why This Target? |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Processing Speed | >100 files/min | Fast enough for practical use |
| Accuracy | >90% | Industry standard for forensics |
| False Positives | <5% | Minimize wasted investigation time |
| Usability | CLI + API | Serves different user types |
| Openness | Open Source | Community benefit and trust |

## Solution Design

### Design Principles

I established guiding principles:

1. **Simplicity First**
   - "Make it work, then make it better"
   - Start with simple rule-based scoring
   - Add ML in later phases

2. **Modularity**
   - Each component does one thing well
   - Easy to test and modify independently
   - Can swap implementations (e.g., different ML models)

3. **Security by Design**
   - Never execute analyzed files
   - Read-only operations
   - Input validation everywhere

4. **Transparency**
   - Explainable results
   - Users understand why a file was flagged
   - Open-source code

### High-Level Design

On paper I sketched the system flow:

```bash
Input → Classification → Feature Extraction → Scoring → Output
```

**Reasoning**: This follows a natural analysis pipeline

### Component Design

#### Why We Chose Python

**Considered**:

- Python
- Javascript
- C

**Decision: Python** ✅

**Reasoning**:

- ✅ Rich ecosystem (pefile, magic, sklearn)
- ✅ Rapid development and more familiar stack
- ✅ Easy for beginners to contribute
- ✅ Strong ML library support
- ⚠️  Slower than C/C++ (acceptable tradeoff)

#### Why This Architecture Was Chosen

**Pattern**: Pipeline Architecture

**Why**:

- Linear flow matches analysis process
- Easy to understand
- Easy to extend (add new stages)
- Easy to test (test each stage independently)
- Faster to implement

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Event-driven: Too complex for this use case
- Microservices: Overkill for single-tool

## Architecture Decisions

### File Structure

```bash
scanlytic/
├── core/           # Core business logic
├── features/       # Feature extraction
├── scoring/        # Risk scoring
├── reporting/      # Output generation
└── utils/          # Helper functions
```

**Why This Structure?**

1. **Separation by Concern**
   - Each directory has clear responsibility
   - Easy to find relevant code

2. **Scalability**
   - Can add more extractors in `features/`
   - Can add more scorers in `scoring/`

3. **Testing**
   - Test files mirror source structure
   - Easy to maintain

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### Decision 1: Analyzer as Orchestrator

**Code**:

```python
class ForensicAnalyzer:
    def analyze_file(self, file_path):
        classification = self.classifier.classify(file_path)
        features = self.extractor.extract(file_path)
        scoring = self.scorer.score(features, classification)
        return self._compile_results(...)
```

**Why**:

- ✅ Single entry point for users
- ✅ Coordinates all components
- ✅ Ensures consistent flow
- ✅ Easy to add logging/metrics

**Alternative**: Let users call components directly

- ❌ More complex for users
- ❌ Easy to miss steps
- ❌ Harder to maintain consistency

#### Decision 2: Configuration Management

**Implementation**:

```python
class Config:
    def __init__(self, config_path=None):
        self.config = self._load_defaults()
        if config_path:
            self._merge_user_config(config_path)
        self._merge_environment_variables()
```

**Why This Approach**:

1. Defaults always work (no required config)
2. File overrides defaults
3. Environment variables override file
4. Precedence is clear

**Reasoning**: Follows "Principle of Least Surprise"

#### Decision 3: Feature Extraction Design

**Interface**:

```python
class FeatureExtractor:
    def extract(self, file_path):
        features = {}
        features.update(self._extract_static())
        features.update(self._extract_hashes())
        features.update(self._extract_entropy())
        features.update(self._extract_strings())
        return features
```

**Why**:

- ✅ Easy to add new feature extractors
- ✅ Each method is independently testable
- ✅ Can enable/disable features via config
- ✅ Graceful degradation (if one fails, others continue)

#### Decision 4: Scoring System Design

**Choice**: Rule-based weighted scoring

**Why Not ML First?**

1. Need labeled training data (don't have yet)
2. Need to prove value before investing in ML
3. Rule-based is explainable
4. Can establish baseline for ML comparison

**Implementation**:

```python
def score(self, features, classification):
    score = 0
    score += self._score_entropy(features) * 0.20
    score += self._score_strings(features) * 0.25
    score += self._score_file_type(classification) * 0.20
    # ... more factors
    return self._normalize_score(score)
```

**Reasoning**: Transparent, tunable, explainable

---

## Development Methodology

### Phase-Based Approach

Development was divided into phases (see ROADMAP.md):

**Phase 1**: Foundation
**Phase 2**: Core Features  ← We are here
**Phase 3**: Advanced Features
**Phase 4**: Production Ready

**Why Phases?**

- ✅ Manageable chunks
- ✅ Clear milestones
- ✅ Can ship working product early
- ✅ Get feedback sooner

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Process**:

1. Write test (it fails)
2. Write minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor
4. Repeat

**Example**:

```python
# Step 1: Write test
def test_md5_hash_calculation():
    content = b"test data"
    expected_hash = "eb733a00c0c9d336e65691a37ab54293"

    result = calculate_md5(content)

    assert result == expected_hash

# Step 2: Run test (fails - function doesn't exist)

# Step 3: Write code
def calculate_md5(data):
    import hashlib
    return hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()

# Step 4: Run test (passes!)
```

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Ensures code works as intended
- ✅ Prevents regressions
- ✅ Serves as documentation
- ✅ Catches bugs early

### Iterative Refinement

Build and refine as I progress, not everything perfectly at first try. I:

1. Built simple version
2. Used it
3. Found problems
4. Fixed problems
5. Repeated

**Example**: Scoring System Evolution

**Version 1**: Simple binary (safe/unsafe)

- Problem: Too crude, many gray areas

**Version 2**: Three levels (safe/suspicious/malicious)

- Problem: Still not granular enough

**Version 3**: 0-100 score with risk levels

- ✅ Works well!

---

## Implementation Process

### How We Built Each Component

#### Example: Building the Classifier

##### Step 1: Research

- How do files differ?
- What are magic numbers?
- What libraries exist?

##### Step 2: Design Interface

```python
class FileClassifier:
    def classify(self, file_path) -> dict:
        """Returns classification info"""
        pass
```

##### Step 3: Implement Core

```python
def classify(self, file_path):
    file_type = self._detect_type(file_path)
    category = self._categorize(file_type)
    return {'type': file_type, 'category': category}
```

##### Step 4: Add Error Handling

```python
def classify(self, file_path):
    try:
        # ... implementation
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileAnalysisError(f"File not found: {file_path}")
    except PermissionError:
        raise FileAnalysisError(f"Permission denied: {file_path}")
```

##### Step 5: Add Logging

```python
def classify(self, file_path):
    logger.info(f"Classifying {file_path}")
    try:
        # ... implementation
        logger.debug(f"Classification: {result}")
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Classification failed: {e}")
        raise
```

##### Step 6: Write Tests

```python
def test_classify_pdf():
    classifier = FileClassifier()
    result = classifier.classify('test.pdf')
    assert result['category'] == 'document'
    assert 'PDF' in result['type']
```

##### Step 7: Document

```python
def classify(self, file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Classify a file based on content and metadata.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to classify

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing:
        - type: Detailed file type
        - category: General category
        - mime_type: MIME type

    Raises:
        FileAnalysisError: If file cannot be classified

    Example:
        >>> classifier = FileClassifier()
        >>> result = classifier.classify('document.pdf')
        >>> print(result['category'])
        'document'
    """
```

### Problem-Solving Examples

#### Problem 1: Memory Issues with Large Files

**Issue**: Reading entire file into memory crashed on large files

**Bad Approach**:

```python
def calculate_hash(file_path):
    data = open(file_path, 'rb').read()  # BAD: Loads entire file
    return hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

**Solution**: Chunked reading

```python
def calculate_hash(file_path):
    hash_obj = hashlib.sha256()
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        while chunk := f.read(8192):  # Read 8KB at a time
            hash_obj.update(chunk)
    return hash_obj.hexdigest()
```

**Lesson**: Always consider resource usage

#### Problem 2: Unknown File Types

**Issue**: Program crashed on unknown file types

**Bad Approach**:

```python
def get_category(file_type):
    categories = {
        'PE32': 'executable',
        'PDF': 'document',
        # ... limited list
    }
    return categories[file_type]  # BAD: Crashes on unknown type
```

**Solution**: Default handling

```python
def get_category(file_type):
    categories = {
        'PE32': 'executable',
        'PDF': 'document',
        # ... list
    }
    return categories.get(file_type, 'unknown')  # Returns 'unknown' if not found
```

**Lesson**: Always handle edge cases

#### Problem 3: Inconsistent Configuration

**Issue**: Users confused about configuration priority

**Bad Approach**: Multiple config systems with unclear precedence

**Solution**: Clear precedence chain

```python
# 1. Load defaults (always available)
config = load_defaults()

# 2. Override with config file (if provided)
if config_file:
    config.update(load_file(config_file))

# 3. Override with environment variables (highest priority)
config.update(load_env_vars())
```

**Lesson**: Clarity > Flexibility

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid

We follow the testing pyramid:

```bash
       /\
      /  \    Few
     / E2E\   Integration Tests
    /______\
   /        \
  /  Unit    \ Many
 /   Tests    \ Unit Tests
/______________\
```

**Why This Shape?**

- Unit tests: Fast, many edge cases
- Integration tests: Verify components work together
- E2E tests: Verify user workflows

### Testing Examples

#### Unit Test: Hash Calculation

```python
def test_md5_hash():
    """Test MD5 hash calculation."""
    test_data = b"Hello, World!"
    expected = "65a8e27d8879283831b664bd8b7f0ad4"

    result = calculate_md5(test_data)

    assert result == expected


def test_empty_file_hash():
    """Test hash of empty file."""
    test_data = b""
    expected = "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"

    result = calculate_md5(test_data)

    assert result == expected
```

**What We Test**:

- ✅ Normal case
- ✅ Edge case (empty file)
- ✅ Expected output matches known value

#### Integration Test: Full Analysis

```python
def test_analyze_known_file():
    """Test complete analysis pipeline."""
    # Create test file
    test_file = create_test_executable()

    # Run analysis
    analyzer = ForensicAnalyzer()
    result = analyzer.analyze_file(test_file)

    # Verify all components ran
    assert 'classification' in result
    assert 'features' in result
    assert 'scoring' in result

    # Verify reasonable output
    assert result['scoring']['score'] >= 0
    assert result['scoring']['score'] <= 100
```

**What We Test**:

- ✅ Components integrate correctly
- ✅ Data flows through pipeline
- ✅ Output structure is correct

### Test-Driven Bug Fixing

When bugs are found:

1. **Write a test that reproduces the bug**
2. **Verify test fails**
3. **Fix the code**
4. **Verify test passes**
5. **Keep the test** (prevents regression)

**Example**:

```python
# Bug report: Crashes on files with special characters in name

def test_file_with_special_characters():
    """Regression test for issue #42"""
    # Create file with special characters
    special_name = "test_file_\u00e9\u00e0.txt"

    # Should not crash
    result = analyzer.analyze_file(special_name)

    assert result is not None
```

---

## Code Quality

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 (Python style guide):

**Good**:

```python
def calculate_entropy(file_path):
    """Calculate Shannon entropy of file."""
    data = read_file_bytes(file_path)

    if not data:
        return 0.0

    entropy = 0.0
    for byte_value in range(256):
        count = data.count(byte_value)
        if count > 0:
            probability = count / len(data)
            entropy -= probability * math.log2(probability)

    return entropy
```

**Bad**:

```python
def calc(fp):  # Unclear name
    d=read(fp)  # No spacing
    if not d:return 0  # Multiple statements on one line
    e=0
    for b in range(256):  # Unclear variable names
        c=d.count(b)
        if c>0:p=c/len(d);e-=p*math.log2(p)  # Unreadable
    return e
```

### Documentation Standards

Every public function has a docstring:

```python
def score(self, features: Dict[str, Any],
          classification: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Calculate malicious intent score for a file.

    Combines multiple risk factors with weighted scoring to produce
    a normalized score between 0-100.

    Args:
        features: Dictionary of extracted file features including:
            - entropy: File entropy (0-8)
            - suspicious_strings: List of suspicious strings found
            - file_size: Size in bytes
        classification: Dictionary with file classification:
            - category: File category (e.g., 'executable')
            - type: Detailed file type

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing:
        - score: Malicious score (0-100)
        - risk_level: Risk category ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical')
        - is_high_risk: Boolean flag
        - risk_factors: List of reasons for the score

    Example:
        >>> features = {'entropy': 7.5, 'file_size': 1024}
        >>> classification = {'category': 'executable'}
        >>> result = scorer.score(features, classification)
        >>> print(result['score'])
        75.5
    """
```

**Elements**:

- Brief description
- Detailed explanation
- Parameter types and descriptions
- Return value details
- Example usage

### Error Handling

We use custom exceptions for clarity:

```python
class FileAnalysisError(Exception):
    """Raised when file analysis fails."""
    pass


class ConfigurationError(Exception):
    """Raised for configuration problems."""
    pass


# Usage
try:
    result = analyze_file(path)
except FileAnalysisError as e:
    logger.error(f"Analysis failed: {e}")
    # User-friendly error message
    print(f"Could not analyze file: {e}")
except ConfigurationError as e:
    logger.error(f"Configuration error: {e}")
    print(f"Configuration problem: {e}")
```

**Benefits**:

- Clear what went wrong
- Appropriate handling for each error type
- User-friendly messages

---

## Documentation Approach

### Types of Documentation

We created different docs for different audiences:

1. **README.md**: Overview (everyone)
2. **BEGINNERS_GUIDE.md**: Students/new programmers
3. **NON_TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md**: Non-technical users
4. **DOCKER_GUIDE.md**: Docker users
5. **API docs**: Developers using as library
6. **This file**: Understanding development process

### Documentation Principles

1. **Assume Nothing**
   - Explain concepts from basics
   - Define technical terms
   - Provide context

2. **Use Examples**
   - Show, don't just tell
   - Real code snippets
   - Expected output

3. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Basic info first
   - Advanced topics later
   - Clear navigation

4. **Keep Updated**
   - Update docs with code changes
   - Version documentation
   - Mark outdated sections

### Writing Style

**Good Example**:

```bash
# Hash Calculation

A hash is like a fingerprint for a file. No two different files
have the same hash (practically speaking).

I calculated three types:
- MD5: Fast, but not secure (legacy support only)
- SHA-1: Better, but still not recommended for security
- SHA-256: Secure, recommended

Example:
```python
hashes = calculate_hashes('file.exe')
print(hashes['sha256'])
# Output: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4...
```

**Bad Example**:

```bash
Hash algo implemented using std libs provides cryptographic
fingerprinting via MD5/SHA families for integrity verification.

# (Too technical, no examples, unclear)
```
